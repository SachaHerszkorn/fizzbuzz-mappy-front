# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

Write a simple fizz-buzz application.

The original fizz-buzz consists in writing all numbers from 1 to 100, and just replacing all multiples of 3 by "fizz", all multiples of 5 by "buzz", and all multiples of 15 by "fizzbuzz". The output would look like this: "1,2,fizz,4,buzz,fizz,7,8,fizz,buzz,11,fizz,13,14,fizzbuzz,16,...".

Your goal is to implement an application that :

Have a form that accepts five parameters : three integers int1, int2 and limit, and two strings str1 and str2.
Display a list of strings with numbers from 1 to limit, where: all multiples of int1 are replaced by str1, all multiples of int2 are replaced by str2, all multiples of int1 and int2 are replaced by str1str2.
Display a statistics view allowing users to know what the most frequent request has been. This view should display a graphical representation of the parameters corresponding to the most complited form, as well as the number of hits for this form.

The application needs to be:
Ready for production
Easy to maintain by other developers
